## User Stories

### Initial stages 

As a user, I want to keep my bear alive so I can watch it grow. I want to play until I beat the game!
The start screen contains instructions:

-Name your bear.
-Keep your bear alive by pressing the buttons in the middle of the screen.
-Your bear will grow and change over time.
-Stay alive along enough to win!
-When you're ready, press "Start".
-Have fun!

The user can name the bear with the form box (optional). The name automatically shows up on the bottom of the screen. 
The red "Start" button on the top will start and restart the game. 
The game contains three main metrics, "Hunger", "Sleepiness", and "Loneliness".
These three metrics are represented by the buttons in the middle of the screen: the "Yellow Utensils" button, the "Blue Bed" button, and the "Red Heart" button. 
The bars will decrease over time. 
When either of the three bar reaches zero (empty), the game will end. 
All progress is lost when the game ends. 
The user will have the option to restart the game and play again.

- Progressing through the game 

After an amount of continuous gameplay without restarting, the bear will "grow up".
The bear's growth will be indicated on three areas: a new picture on the middle of the screen, the text on the bottom of the screen, and notification text on the right part of the screen. 
The bear will grow twice. 
After an amount of continuous gameplay, the user has the game.
